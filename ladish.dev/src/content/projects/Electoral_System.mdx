**Electoral System**! This project is a Python and Flask-based web application that calculates and visualizes election results using a SQL database backend.


## üó≥Ô∏è Project Overview

The Electoral System app allows users to process, analyze, and visualize election data using different voting methods. It leverages a MySQL database for data storage and provides a web interface for running calculations and viewing results.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Multiple Voting Methods:** Calculate results for several electoral systems (e.g., First Past the Post, Proportional Representation).
- **SQL Database Integration:** Uses MySQL for storing and querying election data.
- **Web Interface:** Built with Flask for easy access and interaction.
- **Data Import:** Load datasets via SQL scripts.
- **Visualization:** View results and summaries in the browser.


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Framework:** Flask
- **Database:** MySQL
- **Other:** SQL scripts for schema and data setup


## üöß Challenges & Solutions

- **Database Setup:** Required careful schema design and SQL scripting for importing real election data.
- **Multiple Methods:** Implemented modular Python functions to support different voting systems.
- **Web Integration:** Used Flask to bridge backend calculations and frontend display.


## üìà What I Learned

- How to connect Python apps to MySQL databases
- Building web apps with Flask
- Implementing and comparing different electoral systems


## üöÄ Future Plans

- Add more voting methods and international datasets
- Improve the web UI for better visualization
- Add user authentication and data upload features
