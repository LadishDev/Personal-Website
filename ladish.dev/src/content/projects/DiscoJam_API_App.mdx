Welcome to the **DiscoJam API based App** Project! This project is focused on building a music application that utilizes external APIs to deliver a dynamic and engaging user experience.


## 🎵 Project Overview

DiscoJam is a music application that allows users to search for songs, save their favorites, and discover new music tailored to their tastes. By integrating the Discogs API, the app provides access to a massive library of music metadata, album art, and artist information.


## ✨ Key Features

- **Song Search:** Find songs, albums, and artists using the Discogs API.
- **Save Favorites:** Users can save songs and albums to their personal collection.
- **Music Discovery:** Get recommendations based on listening history and preferences.
- **Rich Metadata:** View detailed information about tracks, albums, and artists.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, responsive GUI for easy navigation.


## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** C++ with OpenFrameworks (for GUI and user interaction)
- **APIs:** Discogs API (primary), with potential for Spotify or Last.fm integration
- **Backend:** Custom C++ logic for API requests and data management


## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

- **API Rate Limiting:** Managed API requests efficiently to avoid hitting rate limits, including caching and request batching.
- **Data Parsing:** Built robust parsers to handle varied and sometimes inconsistent API responses.
- **GUI Design:** Used OpenFrameworks to create a visually appealing and intuitive interface, despite C++ not being a typical choice for modern GUIs.


## 📈 What I Learned

- How to integrate third-party APIs into a C++ application
- Best practices for handling asynchronous API requests and data parsing
- The importance of user experience in music discovery apps


## 🚀 Future Plans

- Migrate to a better API for accurate song info and in-app playback
- Add support for additional APIs (e.g., Spotify, Last.fm)
- Implement playlist creation and sharing
- Add user authentication and cloud sync
- Enhance recommendation algorithms with machine learning
