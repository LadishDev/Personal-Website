This was part of a Research Project for University in which we had to go about developing new things that would help improve the world with either new tech or ideas that havent done before and explore how they would benefit and providing evidence.

The aim of the project I took was to improve the security of RFID/NFC tags as they are fundamentally flawed by being able to easily be cloned with specialised tools. However, there are still some newest technoloiges and developments in the area being made to ensure higher levels of security on card to make them harder to clone. But, at the end of the day the hackers will eventually be able to catch up and break this in order to once again be able to clone these new cards.

This is why I have decided to develop a soloution that invloves MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication) and I focussed on two main options for my research. The first one was utilizing OPT (One-Time Passwords) codes and the other was integrating a facial scanner. I stuck with these as they would be the easiest to implement without costing a lot for a whole building rewire.

Once more research & design protypes had taken place I decided on my OPT soloution has it was the easiest to implement and was cost-saving making it easy for all businesses to easily adopt. I decided against the Facial Scan due to the potential resistance of employees wanting to hand over their biometric data to their workplace or the security system provider. Therefore, leaving OPT codes my winner.

Throughout more protyping and development I came up with the idea that the access control systems could be linked with the employees scheduled work hours enabling their cards to work when they are required in and rejected when presented to the reader out of hours. This provides more security and prevents any card cloning easily being manipulated at night. However, if it is the actual employee trying to gain access for overtime or so on they can use their OPT code on their phones authenticator app to gain access and prove it is them.

Additionally, another security measure I realised that these OPT codes should be tested at random times to ensure everyone has their code on them and works. I had worked this into my protype where depending on the business they could requie a user to have to enter their code every month or so depending on the businesses threat model. Also, if a business has different sectors some more sensitive than others they could also implement door sector based controls to ensure the user is who they say they are when trying to access super high security areas.
