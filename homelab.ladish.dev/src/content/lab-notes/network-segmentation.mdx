## Overview
Planning to implement proper network segmentation using VLANs to improve security and isolate different service categories.

## Proposed VLAN Structure

### VLAN 10 - Management
- UniFi Controller
- Server management interfaces (iDRAC, iLO)
- Network equipment management
- **Access**: Restricted to admin devices only

### VLAN 20 - Services
- Docker containers
- Web services (Nginx, Traefik)
- Database servers
- **Access**: Limited inter-VLAN routing

### VLAN 30 - IoT/Automation
- Home Assistant
- Smart home devices
- IP cameras
- **Access**: No direct internet access, proxied through gateway

### VLAN 40 - Guest
- Guest WiFi
- Isolated from all other networks
- **Access**: Internet only, no local resources

### VLAN 50 - DMZ
- Public-facing services
- Reverse proxy endpoints
- **Access**: Restricted inbound rules

## Firewall Rules
- Default deny all
- Explicit allow rules for required communication
- Logging enabled for denied traffic
- Regular review of logs

## Implementation Steps
1. Document current network topology
2. Configure VLANs on UniFi switch
3. Update DHCP scopes
4. Implement firewall rules incrementally
5. Test service connectivity
6. Update documentation

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Service-to-service communication
- [ ] Internet access from each VLAN
- [ ] Firewall rule validation
- [ ] DNS resolution
- [ ] VPN access to management VLAN
