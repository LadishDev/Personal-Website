## Introduction

Welcome to the world of homelabbing! This guide will help you get started with building your own homelab from scratch.

## What is a Homelab?

A homelab is a personal lab environment where you can experiment with servers, networking, virtualization, and various services in a safe, controlled environment. It's perfect for:

- Learning new technologies
- Testing software before production deployment
- Running personal services (media servers, file storage, etc.)
- Building professional skills
- Having fun with technology!

## Choosing Your Hardware

### Budget Options ($200-500)
- **Raspberry Pi cluster**: Great for learning Kubernetes and containerization
- **Used office PC**: Dell OptiPlex or HP EliteDesk machines are excellent starting points
- **Synology/QNAP NAS**: All-in-one solution for storage and apps

### Mid-Range ($500-1500)
- **Custom-built server**: AMD Ryzen or Intel Core i5/i7 with 32GB+ RAM
- **Used enterprise server**: Dell PowerEdge R720 or HP ProLiant DL380
- **Mini PC**: Intel NUC or similar compact options

### High-End ($1500+)
- **Workstation**: Threadripper or Xeon processors with 64GB+ RAM
- **Modern enterprise servers**: Dell PowerEdge R740 or newer
- **Custom builds**: Multiple servers for different purposes

## Essential Software

### Virtualization Platform
- **Proxmox VE**: Free, open-source, enterprise-grade virtualization
- **VMware ESXi**: Industry standard (free tier available)
- **Hyper-V**: Built into Windows Server

### Operating Systems
- **Ubuntu Server**: Beginner-friendly Linux distribution
- **Debian**: Stable and reliable for servers
- **CentOS/Rocky Linux**: Enterprise-focused options

### Container Platform
- **Docker**: Industry standard for containerization
- **Podman**: Docker alternative with rootless containers
- **Kubernetes**: Production-grade container orchestration

## First Steps

### 1. Install Your Hypervisor
Start with Proxmox VE if you're new:
```bash
# Download Proxmox VE ISO
# Create bootable USB with Rufus or Etcher
# Boot from USB and follow installer
```

### 2. Create Your First VM
- Download Ubuntu Server ISO
- Create a new VM in Proxmox
- Allocate 2GB RAM and 2 CPU cores
- Install Ubuntu Server

### 3. Install Docker
```bash
# Update system
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh

# Add user to docker group
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

### 4. Deploy Your First Service
```bash
# Run Pi-hole for network-wide ad blocking
docker run -d \
  --name pihole \
  -p 53:53/tcp -p 53:53/udp \
  -p 80:80 \
  -e TZ="America/New_York" \
  pihole/pihole:latest
```

## Network Setup

### Basic Network Configuration
1. **Static IP**: Assign a static IP to your server
2. **Port Forwarding**: Configure router for external access
3. **DNS**: Set up local DNS resolution
4. **Firewall**: Configure basic firewall rules

### VLAN Segmentation (Advanced)
- Management VLAN: For server management interfaces
- Services VLAN: For running services
- DMZ VLAN: For public-facing services
- Guest VLAN: For untrusted devices

## Best Practices

### Security
1. **Keep systems updated**: Regular updates are critical
2. **Use strong passwords**: Or better yet, SSH keys
3. **Enable firewalls**: Block unnecessary ports
4. **Regular backups**: Test your backups regularly
5. **Monitor logs**: Watch for suspicious activity

### Organization
1. **Document everything**: Keep notes on configurations
2. **Use version control**: Git for configs and scripts
3. **Label everything**: Physical and virtual resources
4. **Create diagrams**: Network topology and service maps

### Maintenance
1. **Schedule updates**: Regular maintenance windows
2. **Monitor resources**: CPU, RAM, disk usage
3. **Test backups**: Verify backup integrity monthly
4. **Plan upgrades**: Stay current with hardware and software

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Over-complicating**: Start simple, expand gradually
2. **No backups**: Always have a backup strategy
3. **Poor documentation**: Document as you go
4. **Ignoring security**: Security should be priority one
5. **No redundancy**: Plan for failures

## Next Steps

Once you have the basics running:
1. Set up automated backups
2. Implement monitoring (Grafana + Prometheus)
3. Configure reverse proxy (Nginx Proxy Manager)
4. Set up VPN for remote access
5. Explore container orchestration (Docker Compose, then Kubernetes)
