## Overview

Pi-hole is a network-level advertisement and internet tracker blocking application running on my homelab.

I use it to manage my internal proxies to allow me to access my other services internally using domains to make it easier

      - "53:53/udp"
      - "80:80/tcp" # Default HTTP Port
